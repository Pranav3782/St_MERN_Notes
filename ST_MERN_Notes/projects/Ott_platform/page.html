        The film introduces a divine gem born from a drop of blood from Hanuman, which fell into the sea off South India after a young Hanuman was struck by Indra. The gem holds the powers of Hanuman. Near the sea lies Anjanadri, a dystopian village under the tyranny of its polygar, Gajapathi. Hanumanthu, a petty thief from Anjanadri, harbours feelings for Meenakshi, the granddaughter of the local school headmaster. Meenakshi opposes Gajapathi's rule and encourages the villagers to revolt.

Gajapathi, feeling threatened, orchestrates a fake bandit attack on Meenakshi to eliminate her. Hanumanthu, gaining the attention of Meenakshi since childhood under disguise, foils the ambush but is severely injured and thrown into the sea, where he accidentally acquires the divine gem. The next day, he is found unconscious on the shore, alarming his elder sister Anjamma and friend Kasi. However, Hanumanthu's wounds heal instantly, and he gains superhuman strength from the gem when exposed to sunlight, though it loses power without it.
